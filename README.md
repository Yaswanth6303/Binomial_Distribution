# Binomial Distribution 🎲📊

This project demonstrates how to work with the Binomial distribution using Python. It simulates the process of conducting multiple independent Bernoulli trials and visualizes the resulting Binomial distribution.

## 📂 Files

The project contains a Jupyter notebook file:

- `binomial_distribution.ipynb`: The main notebook that demonstrates the creation and visualization of Binomial-distributed random variables.

## 📦 Requirements

To run the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and generating random numbers. ⚙️
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing the distribution in the form of plots. 📈
- `scipy`: For statistical functions and distribution tools. 🔬

You can install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## 📝 Description
1. **Binomial Distribution**: Understanding the behavior of a random variable that counts the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
2. **Visualization**: A plot to visually represent the Binomial distribution with the number of trials and probability of success.
3. **KDE Plot**: A Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot to estimate the probability density function.
4. **Statistical Insights**: Calculating the probability of obtaining a specific number of successes given the number of trials and probability of success.
   
## 📊 Usage
To see the Binomial distribution in action, run the Binomial_Distribution.ipynb file. It will generate plots and explain the underlying principles of the distribution.
